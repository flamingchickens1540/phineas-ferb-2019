# Phineas and Ferb 2019

Team 1540's robot-specific code for our 2019 robots, Phineas and Ferb. Does not include libraries reused from year-to-year; those can be found in [flamingchickens1540/ROOSTER](https://github.com/flamingchickens1540/ROOSTER).


### Git Workflow:
`master` - PR Protected - Only for cleaned up code from `[oregon-city]-cleanup` branches

`[oregon-city]-cleanup` - Branched off of `release` for cleanup and testing before merging into `master`

`release` - Competition branches are merged into here immediately after competitions

`[oregon-city]-competition` - Branched off of `develop` - code used during competition, quick fixes go here, at end of comp merged into "release"

`develop` - Code used for drive practice, staging before the competition

`[feature-branch]` - For working on new features before merging into `develop`, should only be used by the author of the branch
